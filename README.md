# rare-cell-inventory-manager
I created this app as an inventory manager for rare donor blood for a transfusion service.  
A user can do the following:
1. enter units into inventory, 
2. edit a unit's antigen profile (Blood type) as weel as its location, expiration, and unit number
3. delete a unit
4. retrieve a list of units
5. perform a search using multiple antigen parameters to find suitable blood units.
